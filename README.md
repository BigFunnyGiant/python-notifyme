# python-notifyme
This is a modification of the example Python script from the Notify Me Amazon Alexa skill. 

It accepts command line input and can read the API key from a text file, either in the script directory by default or, you can tell it the path using the --api-key-file argument.

It runs with Python 3 if you give it execute permissions. 

run it like this ./notify_me.py "message" --api-key-file /path/to/textfile/with/key

Admittedly written with the help of ChatGPT. Just to see if I could do it.
